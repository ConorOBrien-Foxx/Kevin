# Kevin
Kevin is a language that is very much kevin. Just look at the languages used!

Kevin can accept any valid Java program as input. It also has a predefined header, and allows for `#define` statements in the code.

You can actually remove any of the following files, as they are generated while executing:

  * `splitat.hs` (generated by `split.js`)
  * `balanced.py` (generated by `gen.ijs`)
